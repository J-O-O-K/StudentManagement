Student Management — Database Schema Migrations

## Overview

This repository contains the compulsory assignment for **Database Schema Migrations**.
The goal is to design and evolve a **Student Management** database schema while demonstrating two different migration strategies:

1. **Change-Based (Entity Framework Core / Code-First)**
2. **State-Based (Schema Diff)**

Both approaches are version-controlled and use **feature branches** to show incremental schema changes.
